Which mobile executor is the best?
Last Update: 19/8/23

Codex -
MIGHT BE A VIRUS
Style: Built-in
Key: None
how to do key: -
Advantages: (ONLY USED FOR LIKE 2 MINUTES, IDK)
Disadvatages: ^

Arceus X - (I USED IT LAST LIKE 2 MONTHS AGO. IT HASN'T REALLY CHANGED)
THIS IS A F*CKING VIRUS DON'T USE IT
Style: Executor is built-in. 
Key: The key is 3 checkpoints long and it lasts for one day. 
How to do key: You go to the website and do two linkvertises and a telegram. 
Advantages: It gives you the expiration date of the key, which is nice, and also has starting scripts. 
Disadvantages: However, it crashes Roblox half the time, has no script hub, and the keyboard built-in is nice, but a normal keyboard is better. 
As well as this, the minimized icon when you close the executor is dead in the middle. 
The executor doesn't get many updates.

Fluxus - (I USED IT LAST 19/8/23)
Style: You need to get a separate package and download it into Roblox, it's not built in.
Key: The key is 5 checkpoints (4 linkvertises) long and it lasts for one day. 
How to do key: You go to the website, do a captcha and do a linkvertise. Then you repeat that 4 times. 
Advantages: There is a script hub, ScriptBlox. Roblox doesn't crash most of the time. It has auto-exec and a console.
Disadvantages: Downloading takes a while (5 minutes for me). The key takes a bit too.

Scriptware iOS -
I don't have an iPhone sadly, but it's similar to Fluxus.

Hydrogen - (I USED IT LAST 18/8/23)
Style: Executor is built-in.
Key: The key is 4 checkpoints (3 linkvertises) long and it lasts for one day. 
How to do key: You go to the website, do a captcha and do a linkvertise. Then you repeat that 2 times. 
Advantages: It has different languages to select. There are two script hubs you can choose from, RScripts or Scriptblox. 
Roblox doesn't crash most of the time, and there is a console and auto-exec. 
Disadvantages: It isn't very strong.

Delta: (I USED IT LAST 1/9/23)
Style: Executor is built-in.
Key: 1 checkpoint (1 linkvertise, lasts 1 day)
How to do key: Go to the website, do a linkvertise, then generate a key.
Advantages: Short key. It's similar to Fluxus. It has a script hub, as well as a version of infinite yield built for it (and a couple of default scripts in too). 
It has auto-exec, a console and doesn't crash most of the time.
Disadvantages: Literally nothing. Sadly though, this executor will be closing down at the end of 2023.

What's my ranking?
1. Delta - Literally everything in it is the best.
2. Fluxus - Amazing, but it takes a while to download and the key takes a bit too.
3. Hydrogen - Great, but it's not as strong as Delta and Fluxus.
4. Codex - i guess
5. Arceus X - It doesn't have a script hub and it crashes all the time. Don't use this.
