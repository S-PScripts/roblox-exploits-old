Which mobile executor is the best?

Arceus X - 
Style: Executor is built-in. 
Key: The key is 3 checkpoints long and it lasts for one day. 
How to do key: You go to the website and do two linkvertises and a telegram. 
Advantages: It gives you the expiration date of the key, which is nice, and also has starting scripts. 
Disadvantages: However, it crashes Roblox half the time, has no script hub, and the keyboard built-in is nice, but a normal keyboard is better. As well as this, the minimized icon when you close the executor is dead in the middle. I don't recommend this.

Fluxus/Script-Ware iOS -
Style: You need to get a separate package and download it into Roblox, it's not built in. It doesn't download that well, but it's ok. 
Key: The key is 5 checkpoints long and it lasts for one day. 
How to do key: You go to the website, do a captcha and do a linkvertise. Then you repeat that 4 times. 
Advantages: There is a script hub, ScriptBlox. Roblox doesn't crash most of the time, there's a normal keyboard and auto-execute. 
Disadvantages: Downloading may be troublesome.

Hydrogen -
Style: Executor is built-in.
Key: The key is 5 checkpoints long and it lasts for one day. 
How to do key: You go to the website, do a captcha and do a linkvertise. Then you repeat that 2 times. 
Advantages: It has different languages to select. There are two script hubs you can choose from, RScripts or Scriptblox. Roblox doesn't crash most of the time, there's a normal keyboard and auto-execute. 
Disadvantages: It isn't very strong.

Delta: 
Style: Executor is built-in.
Key: The key lasts for one day. 
How to do key: The key involves a work.ink and that's all. 
Advantages: It's powered by Fluxus. Everything applies there is also here.
Disadvantages: One thing that is annoying about Delta is that pasting a script makes text glitch all over the screen.

What's my ranking?
1. Hydrogen - Downloading is simple. The downside is that it isn't very strong.
2. Fluxus/Script-Ware iOS - Great, but downloading isn't the best.
3. Delta - The ugly-looking glitched script bar is annoying.
4. Arceus X - It not having a script hub and it crashing all the time makes this bad. Don't use this.

DELTA AND FLUXUS ARE GETTING UpdATED SOON!!!!!!!!!!!!
