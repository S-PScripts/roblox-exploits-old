Which mobile executor is the best?

Arceus X - Executor is built-in. The key is 3 checkpoints long and lasts for one day. You go to the website and do two linkvertises and a telegram. It gives you the expire date of the key, which is nice, and also has starting scripts. However, it crashes Roblox half the time, has no script hub, and the keyboard built in is nice, but a normal keyboard is better. As well as this, the minimized icon when you close the executor is dead in the middle. I don't recommend this.
Fluxus/Script-Ware iOS: You need to get a seperate package and download it into Roblox, it's not built in. It doesn't work very well, and the instructions are a bit odd. If you manage to download it, you then have to do a 5 checkpoint key, that expires every day. You go to the website, do a captcha and do a linkvertise. Then you repeat that 4 times. There is a script hub, Roblox doesn't crash most of the time, loadstrings don't crash, there's a normal keyboard and auto-execute. It's not that bad, the main problem is getting it.
Hydrogen: Nothing really different then Fluxus. It has a 3 checkpoint key and it's built in with Roblox. It used to be separate though. It also has different languages to select. Just a note, Hydrogen is usually not up. Expect Hydrogen to not work a lot. Also, the default selection of the script hub is RScripts, I recommend changing it to Scriptblox. Another thing you need to paste the key every time you open Roblox. The others when you do the key and open a game it will automatically start.
Delta: Very similar to Fluxus (literally says it's powered by it). However, it's built in like Hydrogen. The key lasts for one day. The key involves a work.ink and that's all. One thng that is annoying about Delta is that pasting a script makes text appear all over the screen.

What's my ranking?
1. Hydrogen - downloading is simple. only downside is the fact it's usually down.
2. Fluxus/Script-Ware iOS - great, but downloading is awful. Use if Hydrogen is down.
3. Delta - the ugly looking glitched script bar is annoying. But if you can't download Fluxus and Hydrogen is down, it's a go-to.
4. Arceus X - It not having a script hub and it crashing all the time makes this bad. Don't use this.

Update: loadstrings are buggy and large scripts crash.
