Which mobile executor is the best?

Arceus X - The key is 3 checkpoints long and lasts for one day. You go to the website and do two linkvertises and a telegram. It gives you the expire date of the key, which is nice, and also has starting scripts. However, it crashes Roblox half the time, has no script hub, pasting loadstrings crash Roblox and the keyboard built in is nice, but a normal keyboard is better. As well as this, the minimized icon when you close the executor is dead in the middle. I don't recommend this.
Fluxus/Script-Ware iOS: You need to get a seperate package and download it into Roblox, it's not built in. It doesn't work very well, and the instructions are a bit odd. If you manage to download it, you then have to do a 5 checkpoint key, that expires every day. You go to the website, do a captcha and do a linkvertise. Then you repeat that 4 times. There is a script hub, Roblox doesn't crash most of the time, loadstrings don't crash, there's a normal keyboard and auto-execute. It's not that bad, the main problem is getting it.
Hydrogen: Nothing really different then Fluxus. It is built in with Roblox now, but it used to be seperate. It has different languages to select however. Just a note, Hydrogen is usually not up. Expect Hydrogen to not work a lot.
Delta: Very similar to Fluxus. I don't know how long the key lasts. The key involves a work.ink and that's all. One thng that is annoying about Delta is that pasting a script makes text appear all over the screen. You need to use the script hub.

What's my ranking?
1. Hydrogen - downloading is simple. only downside is the fact it's usually down.
2. Fluxus/Script-Ware iOS - great, but downloading is awful. Use if Hydrogen is down.
3. Delta - the broken pasting is annoying. But if you can't download Fluxus, Hydrogen is down and you just want to use normal scripts, it's a go-to.
4. Arceus X - It not having a script hub and it crashing all the time makes this bad. Don't use this.
